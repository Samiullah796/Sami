    <h1><b>Core Tenets and Ethical Foundations of Islam: Pillars, Beliefs, and Values</b></h1>
    <p>Islam is a comprehensive way of life, guided by a set of core tenets and ethical principles that shape the beliefs, practices, and values of Muslims worldwide. These foundational aspects of Islam encompass the Five Pillars, which form the framework of worship and devotion, as well as broader beliefs in the oneness of God, prophethood, divine scriptures, and the Day of Judgment. Additionally, Islam emphasizes moral conduct, justice, equality, and the pursuit of knowledge, promoting peace, compassion, and respect for all humanity. Together, these elements provide a holistic guide for Muslims to lead a righteous and fulfilling life in accordance with Allah's will.</p>
<h2><b>1. Belief in Tawhid (Oneness of God)</b></h2>
<p>Central to Islam is the belief in the absolute oneness of Allah. Muslims believe that Allah is the only deity, without partner, and the creator of everything.</p>
<h2><b>2. Prophethood (Nubuwwah)</b></h2>
<p>
    Muslims believe in all prophets sent by Allah, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). Muhammad is considered the last prophet, and the Quran is the final and complete revelation.</p>
<h2><b>3. Belief in Angels (Mala'ika)</b></h2>
<p> Muslims believe in angels as Allah's messengers and servants. Angels carry out Allah's commands, such as recording human deeds, delivering revelations, and assisting believers.</p>
<h2><b>4. Belief in the Scriptures (Kutub)</b></h2>
<p>
    Muslims believe in the divine books revealed by Allah, including the Torah (Tawrat), the Psalms (Zabur), the Gospel (Injil), and the Quran. The Quran is regarded as the final and most complete revelation.</p>
<h2><b>5. Belief in the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah)</b></h2>
<p>Muslims believe in an afterlife where everyone will be resurrected and judged by Allah based on their deeds in this life. The righteous will be rewarded with paradise (Jannah), while those who disbelieve or commit evil may face punishment in hell (Jahannam).
    </p>
<h3><b><i>6. Divine Decree (Qadar)
    </i></b></h3>
    <p>Muslims believe in divine predestination, meaning that Allah has knowledge of all that will happen and has decreed everything. However, humans still have free will and are responsible for their actions.
</p>
<h4><b>        7. Moral and Ethical Conduct
  </b>
</h4>
<p>  Islam emphasizes moral and ethical conduct, such as honesty, kindness, justice, and humility. Muslims are encouraged to lead a life that reflects these values in their interactions with others.
    </p>
    <h5><b>8. Justice and Equality</b>
  </h5>
  <p>      Islam teaches that all people are equal in the eyes of Allah, regardless of race, gender, or social status. Justice is a central concept in Islam, and Muslims are expected to uphold justice in all aspects of life.
    </p>
    <h5><b>9. Community and Brotherhood (Ummah)</b></h5>
    <p>The concept of the Ummah refers to the global community of Muslims. Islam encourages solidarity, mutual support, and cooperation among all Muslims, regardless of their geographical location.</p>
    <h5><b>10. Education and Knowledge (Ilm)</b></h5>
    <p>Seeking knowledge is highly encouraged in Islam. The pursuit of knowledge, both religious and worldly, is considered a way to better understand Allah's creation and fulfill one's duties.</p>
    <h5><b>    11. Peace and Compassion</b></h5>
<p>Islam is a religion of peace, and Muslims are taught to act with compassion, mercy, and kindness towards all of Allah's creations.
</p>
    <h6><b>    12. Respect for Other Faiths</b></h6>
    <p>Islam teaches respect for people of other faiths and acknowledges the rights of non-Muslims to practice their religion. Muslims are encouraged to engage in dialogue and peaceful coexistence with followers of other religions.
        These principles collectively shape the beliefs, practices, and way of life for Muslims, guiding them in their relationship with Allah, other people, and the world.</p>
